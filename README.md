Kara Woo will present on project-oriented workflows in R. The workshop will
cover the first two modules of the two-day What They Forgot to Teach You About R
workshop (https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/what-they-forgot/). This workshop
is designed for experienced R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R
lifestyle. You'll learn holistic workflows that address the most common sources
of friction in data analysis.

You should take this workshop if: you've been using R for a while and you feel
like writing R code is not what's holding you back the most. You've realized
that you have more pressing "meta" problems that no one seems to talk about: You
want to know how to divide your work into projects and scripts and how to share
your work with others.
